# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project repository. In this project, I worked on the famous Titanic dataset to predict the survival chances of individuals on the Titanic ship. The primary goal of this project is to utilize feature engineering techniques and linear models to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Project Overview

- Explored and analyzed the Titanic dataset for predicting survival chances.
- Utilized feature engineering techniques for data preprocessing.
- Employed both Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models for prediction.

## Feature Engineering

- Utilized the ColumnTransformer to perform basic feature engineering.
- Employed SimpleImputer to handle missing values in the dataset.
- Used one-hot encoding for nominal categorical data.
- Utilized ordinal encoding for ordinal categorical data.

## Linear Models

- Deployed Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models.
- Linear Regression for continuous target prediction.
- Logistic Regression for binary classification prediction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.



## Dependencies

- Python (>=3.6)
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Results

The Titanic survival prediction model utilizes feature engineering and linear models to accurately predict survival chances of passengers. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
